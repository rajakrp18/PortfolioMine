            <h3>System Optimization of Dataset Results Using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Methods (April 2023 -
                April 2024)</h3>

            <pre font="Arial, sans-serif">
                üìç Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-Learn, NumPy & Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn, Optimization
                Algorithms, Datasets, Jupyter Notebook and VS Code.
                ‚Ä¢ Developed an optimized machine learning pipeline integrating Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),
                Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear
                Regression for feature selection and model enhancement.
                ‚Ä¢ Designed a scalable system to improve dataset performance, reducing computation time and enhancing
                model accuracy.
                ‚Ä¢ Applied supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for real-world datasets like Breast Cancer,
                Wine Quality, and Diabetes to derive meaningful insights.
                ‚Ä¢ Optimized feature selection, reducing redundancy and improving model interpretability, achieving
                enhanced accuracy with efficient computation.
                ‚Ä¢ This project bridges optimization techniques with machine learning, ensuring data-driven models are
                both efficient and highly accurate for real-world applications.
